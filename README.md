### **Overview**

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, such as t-shirts, trousers, shoes, and more. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying these images into their respective categories.

### **Libraries and Dependencies**

This project is implemented using the following libraries:

TensorFlow: A deep learning framework used to build and train the CNN model.

Keras: A high-level API for building neural networks, which is used within TensorFlow.

NumPy: Used for array manipulation.
